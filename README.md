Hello welcome to my repo. This is just but a simple Penetretration testing toolkit

Key components include:

Port Scanner – scans open ports (like a mini Nmap).
Basic Vulnerability Checker – checks for common issues (weak headers, open ports, outdated banners).
Password Strength Tester – checks if passwords follow strong policy rules.
Directory Brute Forcer (optional) – attempts to discover hidden directories (like Gobuster).
Report Generator – outputs findings into a simple .txt or .json report.

What It Does

Automates basic reconnaissance and scanning tasks.
Helps demonstrate security testing concepts.
Provides a hands-on tool to test your own lab environment.
